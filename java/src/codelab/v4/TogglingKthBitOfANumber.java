/**
 * For a given number n, if k-th bit is 0, then toggle it to 1 and if it is 1 then, toggle it to 0.
 *
 * Input : n = 6, k = 1
 * Output : 7
 * 6 is represented as 110 in binary and has its first bit 0, so toggling  it will result in 111 i.e. 7.
 *
 * Input : n = 2, k = 3
 * Output : 6
 * 2 is represented as 010 in binary and has its 3rd bit 0, so toggling  it will result in 110 i.e. 6.
 *
 * Input : n = 75, k = 4
 * Output : 67
 * 75 is represented as 1001011 in binary and has its 4th bit 1, so toggling  it will result in 1000011 i.e. 67.
